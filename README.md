# About the project
This project was created as part of a learning journey in order to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage contains various interactive control elements. For instance, there are a bunch of sliders, drop-downs and maps. Furthermore, the webpage is adapted for any screen. It is easy to use the webpage even on a 320px phone. Moreover, the page is adapted for use with a keyboard only and for screen readers. Every option is available without a mouse and from the screen reader, so people with disabilities can use it easily.

# Libraries
1. jQuery (was used to create various interactive components)
2. Swiper (was used to create custom sliders)
3. Choices.js (was used to create drop-down menus)
4. Perfect scrollbar (was used to create scrollbars inside drop-downs)
5. Tippy.js (was used to create tooltips inside text blocks)
